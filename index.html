    Welcome to Kvelíere, the blog, portfolio, and playground of Collin Brown. You'll find an assortment of
    links to my various projects; I mostly write fiction, but I'll also include introductions to a number of
    constructed languages of mine, in addition to any worldbuilding notes I want to share. In addition, I'm likely
    to publish articles discussing any of my honestly quite ecclectic interests. I'm especially fascinated by
    history, linguistics, programming, literature, and any combination thereof.
    <br>
    <br>
    I program in C++ or C# for the most part, but I have experience with Python and a few other languages. I've
    some experience with Unity, but these days I've been working with OpenGL, coding the systems you'd find in the
    former from scratch: a better way to learn how they all really work under the hood, I've found. I
    particularly enjoy coding the sorts of games I like to play: roguelikes (of the Nethack variety), sims (in the
    vein of Dwarf Fortress), and grand strategy games (such as Crusader Kings 2). You can likely glean more of
    my personality from this list than I'd like to admit.
    <br>
    <br>
    As for linguistics, I've reached an intermediate level in Spanish (bienvenidos!) and working to do the same
    in Japanese (ようこそ), but I've also spent a little time—read, too little—with French and (even less with)
    Arabic. That's not to say those are the only languages with which I'm familiar in terms of phonology or
    grammar, only those which I've spent any respectable length of time trying to learn.

    I recently transitioned to this site, hence its sparseness. Expect more to arrive soon.
