<p>Hello and welcome to my little backwater website where I'll be featuring bits of the fiction, conlangs,
    <br> and other miscellaneous works I've been toying around with. There won't be much on here for a while,
    <br> as I'm busy working on a few (read, several) other projects that are time-sensitive, but at some point
    <br> I hope to begin putting stuff up regularly. I've yet to decide what fiction I'll put up, but I've thrown
    <br> a few things in the conlang section; I imagine the blog will remain empty longer than the others as I'm
    <br> not particularly inclined to writing posts, but perhaps I'll find some inspiration somewhere. In any case,
    <br> you can expect to find (at some future date) an archive of my writings on here. I do hope you enjoy them. </p>
