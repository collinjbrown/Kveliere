# An Introduction

*The Little Brown Book* is a sort of subsection of this blog
which I intend to use for my personal essays, ideas, and musings.
I suppose this is meant to stand in contrast to the more
portfolio-esque parts of [[Kvel√≠ere.com]{.ul}](https://www.kveliere.com/),
the sections dedicated to fiction and constructed languages, in that those are
meant for others to read but I expect no one to actually delve into
any of what you'll find *here.* What I'll write here will mostly be
for my own entertainment or to put into ink certain thoughts for later
reference.

In any case, I wouldn't take anything I put here too seriously.
